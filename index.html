				<h4>More About the Next Evolution of Health Telesummit</h4>
				<p>
					In the last decades, we've seen wave after wave of innovation beyond traditional health care. <br/>
					 We've begun integrating East and Western models, alternative healing practices,  nutrition <br/>
					 and more. Now we're increasingly including consciousness work such as meditation, visualization, <br/>
					subtle energies, and even distant prayer, along with a growing recognition of the power of our <br/>
					beliefs and intentions. <br/><br/>
					
					As a result, we're moving beyond a mechanistic disease-driven model of health to one in which we <br/>
					recognize how important prevention, nutrition, psychology, beliefs, personal practices, and optimal <br/>
					living are to vibrant health.   With those shifts, we're addressing a person's health holistically and <br/>
					seeing how it is interconnected with the health of society. <br/><br/>
					

					This free weekend teleseminar event brings together some of the world's top pioneers in integral <br/>
					health, wellness and mind-body-spirit medicine to showcase the latest insights, research, and <br/>
					practices that are proving to work to create vibrant, healthy lives and to transform our health care institutions.<br/><br/>
					

					There is no question that then conventional model of health care has broken down.  The question is <br/>
					 "How best to fix it?"  Our answer is to integrate the deepest insights and research of those leading <br/>
					 the way forward.  We can each take personal responsibility for creating optimal health in our lives <br/>
					 by learning from the pioneering work now underway. <br/><br/>

					This conference connects people around the world with medical and health pioneers helping us to <br/>
					evolve to a new level of health and well-being.
